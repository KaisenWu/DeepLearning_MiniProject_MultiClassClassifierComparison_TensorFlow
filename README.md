# DeepLearning_MiniProject_MultiClassClassifierComparison_TensorFlow

Project Overview:

This project used TensorFlow classification technique to find the best layer parameter of ANN model to predict the class by two features. The main techniques which were used in this project contains:

1. TensorFlow Sequential classifier.
2. Early stop function.
3. MinMax scaler.
4. Hyperparameter tuning.
5. Multi-class classifier evaluation.

About The Dataset:

1. This project used a anonymous dataset which dosen't include any context.
2. The dataset has 2 predicted features and 1 target feature.
